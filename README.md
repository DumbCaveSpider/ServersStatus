### About
Display the server and internet connection status in-game! It checks if <cg>Geode</c>, <cg>Boomlings</c>, <cg>Globed's Argon</c> and your <cg>Internet Connection</c> are up or down, and displays the icon status as well as a popup with more information.
You can also add your own custom services to check if they are up or down!

The following colors are used to indicate the icon status:
- <cg>**Green:** All services are up</c>
- <co>**Orange:** One or more services are down</c>
- <cr>**Red:** All services are down</c>
